## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/branchmetrics/react-native-branch/issues) to make sure your issue hasn’t already been reported.

### Help Us Help You

Take some time to structure your code and question in a way that is easy to read to entice people to answer it. For example, we encourage you to use syntax highlighting, indentation, and split text in paragraphs.

## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/branchmetrics/react-native-branch/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

To get started developing:
1. fork the repo
2. clone react-native-branch locally
3. `cd react-native-branch && npm i`

Before submitting a PR, test the new functionality or bugfix in android & ios, and if possible write a unit test.

### Testing and Linting

All contributions must pass `eslint` and `npm test` before being accepted.

### Docs

Improvements to the documentation are always welcome. In the docs we abide by typographic rules, so instead of ' you should use ’. Same goes for “ ” and dashes (—) where appropriate. These rules only apply to the text, not to code blocks.

## Thanks

Thank you for contributing!
