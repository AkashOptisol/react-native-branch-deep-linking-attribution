# testbed sample app

## Building for iOS

Install dependencies from NPM using:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn
```

Then simply build and run the Xcode project or use

```bash
react-native run-ios
```

There is no need to install the Branch SDK via `pod install` or
another method. It is included in the ios/Pods subdirectory.

## Building for Android

*Work in progress*
