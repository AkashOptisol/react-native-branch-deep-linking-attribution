# testbed_carthage

This app was built with react-native-branch@1.1.1 using Carthage to integrate the iOS SDK.

## Building

Just run `npm install` or `yarn` to install Node dependencies in node_modules. There is no need to install or run Carthage. The native dependencies are checked into the repo.
